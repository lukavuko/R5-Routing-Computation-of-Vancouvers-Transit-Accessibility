This is the deployed dashboard for visualizing [Vancouver's cultural amenity transit accessibility](https://github.com/lukavuko/High-Performing-Approach-to-Computing-Urban-Transit-Accessibility). The directories are pre-loaded with html renderings of our accessibility scoring measures, developed using the [R5-Routing algorithm](https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/)
